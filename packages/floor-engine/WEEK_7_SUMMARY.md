## Production Deployment Recommendation

### Deployment Strategy

**Phase 1** (Week 1): Infrastructure deployment, 0% capital
- Deploy Floor Engine to all chains
- Verify all adapters healthy
- Test with minimal capital (0.1 ETH)

**Phase 2** (Week 2): Initial allocation, 5% capital
- Allocate 5% of total capital
- Monitor closely (daily checks)
- Validate APY targets

**Phase 3** (Week 3): Scale to 25% capital
- Increase allocation to 25%
- Continue monitoring
- Validate performance

**Phase 4** (Week 4): Scale to 50% capital
- Increase allocation to 50%
- Ongoing monitoring
- Optimize as needed

**Phase 5** (Ongoing): Full deployment
- Scale to 100% as confidence grows
- Implement Phase III enhancements
- Continuous optimization

### Risk Mitigation
